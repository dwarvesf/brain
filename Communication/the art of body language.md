## What is body language?

Body language is something that we're all fascinated with. Body language is nonverbal communication, and social scientists have spent a lot of time studying how our own body language, as well as the body language of others, affects our judgments. We form broad conclusions and generalizations based on body language. And such decisions may have a significant impact on our lives, such as who we employ or promote, or who we ask out on a date. For example, Nalini Ambady, a Tufts University researcher, found that when individuals view 30-second soundless video of genuine physician-patient encounters, their perceptions of the doctor's niceness predict whether or not the doctor would be sued. 

## The impact of it
Body language has a significant impact on how we assess people, how they judge us, and the results. Nonverbal signs of power and dominance in the animal kingdom include growing to appear larger and so more powerful, and humans do the same. When we feel helpless, on the other hand, we close down and shrink. Is it feasible, however, that we might persuade individuals to lie in order to encourage them to engage more and enhance their grades? 

## How does it works?
You are more likely to feel strong if you act forceful. Our bodies can alter our brains, just as our minds may change our bodies. There are several distinctions between powerful and powerless individuals. There are also physiological variations in two crucial hormones: testosterone (the dominance hormone) and cortisol (the stress hormone). In a study, we discovered that people's hormones and stress levels vary depending on their posture.

## Advice
In conclusion, small tweaks can lead to big changes. You can configure your brain to cope best with any given situation. Try power posing and share the science. Share it with the people who are powerless and need it most as it can significantly change the outcomes of their lives.
