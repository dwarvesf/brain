Devbox is a command-line tool that allows us to easily create a predictable development environment powered by [Nix](https://nixos.org/). By using [¶ Nix Shell](./¶%20Nix%20Shell.md), Devbox provides an environment that is reproducible, isolated, and portable. In this environment, we can install more than 80,000 application build instances from [NixOS/nixpkgs](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs) and also directly use [¶ Nix Flakes](./¶%20Nix%20Flakes.md). This entire environment is managed by the Nix Package Manager under an [Effective Development Environment Management](./Effective%20Development%20Environment%20Management.md) system.
