A Flake is essentially a file system managed by a file named `flake.nix` that we can modify. Additionally, a `flake.lock` file is used to lock dependency versions. This structure is similar to `package.json` and `package-lock.json` in the Node.js ecosystem.

Imagine we have application source code that we want to expose as a Nix package for others to use in a reproducible and discoverable way, without worrying about incompatibility or build issues. Nix Flakes allows us to do that.

By defining `flake.nix`, we can not only specify information about all the dependencies we need to run our application as the input of the flake, but also decide what the output of our flake will be, based on our source code.

Finally, our application can be fetched and used by other Nix packages freely.
