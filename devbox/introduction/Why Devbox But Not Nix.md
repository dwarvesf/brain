Once we choose to use Devbox, it means we want to focus on finding a way to build an [Effective Development Environment Management](./Effective%20Development%20Environment%20Management.md) quickly and simply.

Devbox is powered by Nix for building portable, isolated dev environments on any machine. So it can take advantage of almost all Nix features in aspects such as: [¶ Nix Shell](./¶%20Nix%20Shell.md) and [¶ Nix Flakes](./¶%20Nix%20Flakes.md). Devbox also has some advantages over Nix.

- First, because Nix is general-purpose, it might require additional setup for development-specific workflows compared to Devbox, which focuses solely on development environments.

- Devbox provides a more user-friendly interface compared to Nix, making it easier for developers who may not be familiar with Nix to set up and manage development environments. For more details, let's take a look at the [Nix Language](https://nix.dev/manual/nix/2.18/language/), which is something that we need to be familiar with to use Nix smoothly. With Devbox, we only need to use commands and a transparent JSON file for configuration.
