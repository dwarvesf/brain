What does effective development environment management look like in your mind? Does it include the following?

- A consistent shell for everyone on the team
- Trying new tools without polluting your laptop
- Not sacrificing speed
- Saying goodbye to conflicting versions
- Taking your environment with you

Devbox gives us the ability to achieve all of the above.

Simply put, Devbox provides a file called `devbox.json`, in which we can define the entire development environment that we need. This includes the list of dependencies, environment variables, and how this environment is initialized, such as through hook scripts.

Once we start Devbox, everything in this `devbox.json` will be installed, initialized, and executed automatically in the same way every time, consistently on every machine.

To arrange for everything to work as expected in the order above, Devbox is actually powered by Nix. We can refer to [¶ Nix Shell](./¶%20Nix%20Shell.md) for a first look. Then, see [Why Devbox But Not Nix?](./Why%20Devbox%20But%20Not%20Nix.md) for the reasons why we use Devbox instead of Nix directly.
