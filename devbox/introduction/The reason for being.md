## The Pursuit of Consistency
In our pursuit of creating consistent development experiences for our team, we initially turned to Docker. By encapsulating our development environment within a Docker container, we aimed to provide a standardized setup that could be easily shared among team members. 

## Docker's Achilles Heel
While Docker excels at providing repeatability, allowing us to run the same container across different machines, it falls short in ensuring reproducibility. The root of this issue lies in Docker's ability to access the internet during the build process. This means that the resulting image can vary each time it is built, as dependencies and packages sourced from the internet are subject to change.

One more point, as our projects grew in complexity, we faced significant challenges. Docker containers became resource-intensive, with our development container growing over GB. This led to prolonged environment creation and package upgrade times, high CPU usage causing laptop overheating, and excessive memory consumption. These issues hindered our productivity and prompted us to seek a more efficient solution.

## Devbox: The Reproducibility Champion
Devbox, powered by Nix, revolutionizes reproducibility by enforcing immutable external sources. With Devbox, we define our development environment by specifying exact packages and dependencies. This ensures that given the same build expression, Devbox consistently produces identical environments every time. New team members can quickly get started by installing Devbox and running the predefined environment, eliminating lengthy setup processes

## Resource-Efficient Development
Devbox's lightweight nature and efficient resource utilization ensure that our development environments are not only reproducible but also resource-friendly, avoiding the performance bottlenecks and excessive resource consumption we faced with Docker.

## Conclusion
Embracing Devbox has not only streamlined our development process but has also fostered a more collaborative and productive team dynamic. As we continue to scale our projects, Devbox's reproducibility and efficiency will undoubtedly remain key factors in our success.
