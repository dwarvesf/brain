description: An overview of how Nix addresses issues like shadow copies in Docker builds, improving build efficiency and speed

The reproducible issue is resolved in the [previous part](./â‰ˆ%20Nix%20-%20Build%20the%20same%20thing%20at%20any%20time.md). But we still have another problem when using Docker build, it is shadow copies. This issue comes from the underutilization of Content-addressable storage in Docker of Docker build. It even lets build time slower.

- [Content-addressable storage in Docker](./Content-addressable%20storage%20in%20Docker.md)
- [Nix is faster than Docker build](./Nix%20is%20faster%20than%20Docker%20build.md)
