The Triple S of UX is a paradigm used to simplify key approaches to user experience for Web3 and allows it to be more accessible for others. It addresses concerns on user-friendliness, as a lot of terminology and know-how required to navigate through Web3 makes it difficult for the average user to be engaged in a product. For instance, terms such as "Gas Fees", "Private Key", and "Public address" are not day-to-day terms that most users would be familiar with. The Triple S of UX focuses on these three concepts:

## Simple

Familiar, easy-to-understand method for users to onboard and get started, and interact with decentralized applications.

**Sample** An intuitive and convenient login method.

## Secure

Give users the security assurance from start to end, as required.

**Sample** Enable 2-factor authentication to increase the trust that users place on providers to safeguard their assets.

## Self-custodial

Ensure design communicates the empowerment users should have; allow them to benefit from the decentralized ecosystem.

**Sample** Web3Auth Key Infrastructure ensures users can recover their accounts and no one entity can restrict access to their assets.
