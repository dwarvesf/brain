Extensions are more powerful than web apps because they can access both [Javascrips API]([Web APIs | MDN (mozilla.org)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API)) and [Chrome APIs]([Web APIs | MDN (mozilla.org)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API)) . Web apps can only access the first one.

Extensions use the same web technologies with web apps (html, css, js) and can use servcie worker too. Actually extensions use service worker to handle browser events.
