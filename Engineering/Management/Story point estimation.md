During the team sprint-planning meeting, story points estimation is one of the important part when defining the works in the future sprint for each members in the team. A good estimation will help product owners optimize for efficiency and impact. How do we do the estimation precisely?

## Collaborate with your project manager, product owner
Usually, before the sprint planning happens, PM/PO will take time to prepare for the tickets are going to do in the future sprint - most of the tickets are captured based on the desired features and fixs for a product from customer's requirements.
 
Hence, those tickets are in the very common statement since most of the PM/PO does not understand much from the technical site for the implementation. Leading to hard for all of the members to estimate their work.

So, to separate works precisely and more easy to estimate, a team members can give PMs new insight into the level of effort for each work item. Like, can giving PMs a definition of their work for example.

## Agile estimation is a team sport
During the estimation, it should be involving by eveyone members in the team (developers, designers, testers, etc.). Why? Because each of them will have a different perspective on the product and the work required to deliver for the feature.

## Estimate smarter, not harder
Usually, when estimating, we will based on the time that our member need to finish their work. For example: 1-2 points for about 2-4 hours. So when having a big requirement ticket, we should break it into the subtasks or smaller tasks to keep track the work better and easy for the team to estimate also.

## Learn from the past estimates
After every sprint, we have a meeting calls "Retrospectives", each members will giving their opinion about the previous sprint. We will based on to discuss and give the proper solution on the next job for estimating the work better for the team.
